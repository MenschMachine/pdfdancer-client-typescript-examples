Forms workflows aligned with "Working with AcroForms" in the docs. Each script
operates on `examples/Showcase.pdf` and saves results to
`output/working-with-forms/`.

- `01_list_fields.ts` – display field names, types, and values.
- `02_fill_fields.ts` – populate common fields by name.
- `03_check_boxes.ts` – toggle checkbox widgets.
- `04_clear_fields.ts` – reset fields back to empty values.
