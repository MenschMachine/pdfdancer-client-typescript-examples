Image manipulation scenarios aligned with the "Working with Images" docs.
Every script uses `examples/Showcase.pdf` and writes results to
`output/working-with-images/`.

- `01_list_images.ts` – list image metadata and coordinates.
- `02_move_image.ts` – reposition the first page image.
- `03_delete_images.ts` – remove all images from a page.
